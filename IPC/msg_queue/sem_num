DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Each semaphore in a System V semaphore set has the following associated values:

           unsigned short  semval;   /* semaphore value */
           unsigned short  semzcnt;  /* # waiting for zero */
           unsigned short  semncnt;  /* # waiting for increase */
           pid_t           sempid;   /* ID of process that did last op */

       sseemmoopp() performs operations on selected semaphores in the set indicated by _s_e_m_i_d.
       Each of the _n_s_o_p_s elements in the array pointed to by _s_o_p_s is  a  structure  that
       specifies  an  operation  to be performed on a single semaphore.  The elements of
       this structure are of type _s_t_r_u_c_t _s_e_m_b_u_f, containing the following members:

           unsigned short sem_num;  /* semaphore number */
           short          sem_op;   /* semaphore operation */
           short          sem_flg;  /* operation flags */

       Flags recognized in _s_e_m___f_l_g are IIPPCC__NNOOWWAAIITT and SSEEMM__UUNNDDOO.  If an operation  speci‐
       fies SSEEMM__UUNNDDOO, it will be automatically undone when the process terminates.

       The  set  of operations contained in _s_o_p_s is performed in _a_r_r_a_y _o_r_d_e_r, and _a_t_o_m_i_‐
       _c_a_l_l_y, that is, the operations are performed either as a complete unit, or not at
       all.   The  behavior  of  the  system call if not all operations can be performed
       immediately depends on the presence of the  IIPPCC__NNOOWWAAIITT  flag  in  the  individual
       _s_e_m___f_l_g fields, as noted below.

       Each  operation  is  performed  on the _s_e_m___n_u_m-th semaphore of the semaphore set,
       where the first semaphore of the set is numbered 0.  There  are  three  types  of
       operation, distinguished by the value of _s_e_m___o_p.

       If  _s_e_m___o_p  is a positive integer, the operation adds this value to the semaphore
       value (_s_e_m_v_a_l).  Furthermore, if SSEEMM__UUNNDDOO is specified for  this  operation,  the
       system  subtracts  the  value _s_e_m___o_p from the semaphore adjustment (_s_e_m_a_d_j) value
       for this semaphore.  This operation can always proceed—it never forces  a  thread
       to wait.  The calling process must have alter permission on the semaphore set.

       If  _s_e_m___o_p  is  zero, the process must have read permission on the semaphore set.
       This is a "wait-for-zero" operation: if _s_e_m_v_a_l is zero, the operation can immedi‐
       ately  proceed.   Otherwise, if IIPPCC__NNOOWWAAIITT is specified in _s_e_m___f_l_g, sseemmoopp() fails
       with _e_r_r_n_o set to EEAAGGAAIINN (and none of the operations in _s_o_p_s is performed).  Oth‐
       erwise,  _s_e_m_z_c_n_t  (the  count  of  threads  waiting  until this semaphore's value
       becomes zero) is incremented by one and the thread sleeps until one of  the  fol‐
       lowing occurs:

       ·  _s_e_m_v_a_l becomes 0, at which time the value of _s_e_m_z_c_n_t is decremented.

       ·  The semaphore set is removed: sseemmoopp() fails, with _e_r_r_n_o set to EEIIDDRRMM.

       ·  The  calling  thread catches a signal: the value of _s_e_m_z_c_n_t is decremented and
          sseemmoopp() fails, with _e_r_r_n_o set to EEIINNTTRR.

       If _s_e_m___o_p is less than zero, the process must have alter permission on the  sema‐
       phore  set.   If _s_e_m_v_a_l is greater than or equal to the absolute value of _s_e_m___o_p,
       the operation can proceed immediately: the absolute value of _s_e_m___o_p is subtracted
       from  _s_e_m_v_a_l,  and,  if SSEEMM__UUNNDDOO is specified for this operation, the system adds
       the absolute value of _s_e_m___o_p to the semaphore adjustment (_s_e_m_a_d_j) value for  this
       semaphore.   If  the  absolute  value  of  _s_e_m___o_p  is  greater  than  _s_e_m_v_a_l, and
       IIPPCC__NNOOWWAAIITT is specified in _s_e_m___f_l_g, sseemmoopp() fails, with _e_r_r_n_o set to EEAAGGAAIINN  (and
       none of the operations in _s_o_p_s is performed).  Otherwise, _s_e_m_n_c_n_t (the counter of
       threads waiting for this semaphore's value to increase) is incremented by one and
       the thread sleeps until one of the following occurs:

       ·  _s_e_m_v_a_l  becomes  greater  than  or  equal to the absolute value of _s_e_m___o_p: the
          operation now proceeds, as described above.

       ·  The semaphore set is removed from the system: sseemmoopp() fails, with _e_r_r_n_o set to
          EEIIDDRRMM.

       ·  The  calling  thread catches a signal: the value of _s_e_m_n_c_n_t is decremented and
          sseemmoopp() fails, with _e_r_r_n_o set to EEIINNTTRR.

       On successful completion, the _s_e_m_p_i_d value for each semaphore  specified  in  the
       array  pointed  to  by  _s_o_p_s is set to the caller's process ID.  In addition, the
       _s_e_m___o_t_i_m_e is set to the current time.

   sseemmttiimmeeddoopp(())
       sseemmttiimmeeddoopp() behaves identically to sseemmoopp() except that in those cases where  the
       calling  thread  would sleep, the duration of that sleep is limited by the amount
       of elapsed time specified by the _t_i_m_e_s_p_e_c structure whose address  is  passed  in
       the  _t_i_m_e_o_u_t  argument.   (This  sleep  interval will be rounded up to the system
       clock granularity, and kernel scheduling delays mean that the interval may  over‐
       run  by  a small amount.)  If the specified time limit has been reached, sseemmttiimmee‐‐
       ddoopp() fails with _e_r_r_n_o set to EEAAGGAAIINN (and none of the operations in _s_o_p_s is  per‐
       formed).  If the _t_i_m_e_o_u_t argument is NULL, then sseemmttiimmeeddoopp() behaves exactly like
       sseemmoopp().

       Note that if sseemmttiimmeeoopp() is interrupted by a signal, causing  the  call  to  fail
       with the error EEIINNTTRR, the contents of _t_i_m_e_o_u_t are left unchanged.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       If  successful,  sseemmoopp() and sseemmttiimmeeddoopp() return 0; otherwise they return -1 with
       _e_r_r_n_o indicating the error.

EERRRROORRSS
       On failure, _e_r_r_n_o is set to one of the following:

       EE22BBIIGG  The argument _n_s_o_p_s is greater than SSEEMMOOPPMM, the maximum  number  of  opera‐
              tions allowed per system call.

       EEAACCCCEESS The  calling process does not have the permissions required to perform the
              specified semaphore operations, and does not have the CCAAPP__IIPPCC__OOWWNNEERR  capa‐
              bility.

       EEAAGGAAIINN An operation could not proceed immediately and either IIPPCC__NNOOWWAAIITT was spec‐
              ified in _s_e_m___f_l_g or the time limit specified in _t_i_m_e_o_u_t expired.

       EEFFAAUULLTT An address specified in either the _s_o_p_s  or  the  _t_i_m_e_o_u_t  argument  isn't
              accessible.

       EEFFBBIIGG  For  some operation the value of _s_e_m___n_u_m is less than 0 or greater than or
              equal to the number of semaphores in the set.

       EEIIDDRRMM  The semaphore set was removed.

       EEIINNTTRR  While blocked in this system call, the thread caught a  signal;  see  ssiigg‐‐
              nnaall(7).

       EEIINNVVAALL The  semaphore set doesn't exist, or _s_e_m_i_d is less than zero, or _n_s_o_p_s has
              a nonpositive value.

       EENNOOMMEEMM The _s_e_m___f_l_g of some operation specified SSEEMM__UUNNDDOO and the system  does  not
              have enough memory to allocate the undo structure.

       EERRAANNGGEE For  some  operation _s_e_m___o_p_+_s_e_m_v_a_l is greater than SSEEMMVVMMXX, the implementa‐
              tion dependent maximum value for _s_e_m_v_a_l.

       sseemmttiimmeeddoopp() first appeared in Linux 2.5.52, and was subsequently backported into
       kernel 2.4.22.  Glibc support for sseemmttiimmeeddoopp() first appeared in version 2.3.3.

       The  inclusion of _<_s_y_s_/_t_y_p_e_s_._h_> and _<_s_y_s_/_i_p_c_._h_> isn't required on Linux or by any
       version of POSIX.  However, some old implementations required  the  inclusion  of
       these  header  files, and the SVID also documented their inclusion.  Applications
       intended to be portable to such old systems may  need  to  include  these  header
       files.

       The  _s_e_m___u_n_d_o  structures  of a process aren't inherited by the child produced by
       ffoorrkk(2), but they are inherited across an eexxeeccvvee(2) system call.

       sseemmoopp() is never automatically restarted after being interrupted by a signal han‐
       dler, regardless of the setting of the SSAA__RREESSTTAARRTT flag when establishing a signal
       handler.

       A semaphore adjustment (_s_e_m_a_d_j) value is  a  per-process,  per-semaphore  integer
       that is the negated sum of all operations performed on a semaphore specifying the
       SSEEMM__UUNNDDOO flag.  Each process has a list of _s_e_m_a_d_j values—one value for each sema‐
       phore  on  which it has operated using SSEEMM__UUNNDDOO.  When a process terminates, each
       of its per-semaphore _s_e_m_a_d_j values is added to the corresponding semaphore,  thus
       undoing  the  effect  of that process's operations on the semaphore (but see BUGS
       below).  When a semaphore's value is directly set  using  the  SSEETTVVAALL  or  SSEETTAALLLL
       request  to  sseemmccttll(2),  the  corresponding  _s_e_m_a_d_j  values  in all processes are
       cleared.  The cclloonnee(2) CCLLOONNEE__SSYYSSVVSSEEMM flag allows more than one process to share a
       _s_e_m_a_d_j list; see cclloonnee(2) for details.

       The  _s_e_m_v_a_l,  _s_e_m_p_i_d,  _s_e_m_z_c_n_t,  and  _s_e_m_n_c_t  values  for  a semaphore can all be
       retrieved using appropriate sseemmccttll(2) calls.

   SSeemmaapphhoorree lliimmiittss
       The following limits on semaphore set resources affect the sseemmoopp() call:

       SSEEMMOOPPMM Maximum number of operations allowed for one sseemmoopp() call.   Before  Linux
              3.19,  the  default  value  for  this limit was 32.  Since Linux 3.19, the
              default value is 500.  On Linux, this limit can be read and  modified  via
              the  third  field of _/_p_r_o_c_/_s_y_s_/_k_e_r_n_e_l_/_s_e_m.  _N_o_t_e: this limit should not be
              raised above 1000, because of the risk of that sseemmoopp(2) fails due to  ker‐
              nel memory fragmentation when allocating memory to copy the _s_o_p_s array.

       SSEEMMVVMMXX Maximum allowable value for _s_e_m_v_a_l: implementation dependent (32767).

       The  implementation  has no intrinsic limits for the adjust on exit maximum value
       (SSEEMMAAEEMM), the system wide maximum number of undo structures (SSEEMMMMNNUU) and the per-
       process maximum number of undo entries system parameters.

BBUUGGSS
       When  a  process  terminates,  its set of associated _s_e_m_a_d_j structures is used to
       undo the effect of all of the semaphore operations it performed with the SSEEMM__UUNNDDOO
       flag.   This raises a difficulty: if one (or more) of these semaphore adjustments
       would result in an attempt to decrease  a  semaphore's  value  below  zero,  what
       should  an  implementation do?  One possible approach would be to block until all
       the semaphore adjustments could be performed.  This is however undesirable  since
       it  could  force  process  termination  to  block  for  arbitrarily long periods.
       Another possibility is that such semaphore adjustments  could  be  ignored  alto‐
       gether  (somewhat analogously to failing when IIPPCC__NNOOWWAAIITT is specified for a sema‐
       phore operation).  Linux adopts a third approach: decreasing the semaphore  value
       as  far  as  possible (i.e., to zero) and allowing process termination to proceed
       immediately.

       In kernels 2.6.x, x <= 10, there is a bug that in some circumstances  prevents  a
       thread  that  is waiting for a semaphore value to become zero from being woken up
       when the value does actually become zero.  This bug is fixed in kernel 2.6.11.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
       The following code segment uses sseemmoopp() to atomically wait for the value of sema‐
       phore 0 to become zero, and then increment the semaphore value by one.

           struct sembuf sops[2];
           int semid;

           /* Code to set _s_e_m_i_d omitted */

           sops[0].sem_num = 0;        /* Operate on semaphore 0 */
           sops[0].sem_op = 0;         /* Wait for value to equal 0 */
           sops[0].sem_flg = 0;

           sops[1].sem_num = 0;        /* Operate on semaphore 0 */
           sops[1].sem_op = 1;         /* Increment value by one */
           sops[1].sem_flg = 0;

           if (semop(semid, sops, 2) == -1) {
               perror("semop");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
